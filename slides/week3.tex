\section{Introduction to Prolog}

\begin{frame}{Prolog}

Prolog: \emph{Pro}gramming \emph{Log}ic

\pause

\bigskip

Prolog grew out of research on Artificial Intelligence!
\end{frame}    

\begin{frame}{From Datalog to Prolog: A Shift in Perspective}
Datalog is based on \emph{bottom-up} evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Datalog has a unique minimal model.
    \item Datalog offers strong guarantees about termination.
    \item Limited expressive power.
\end{itemize}

Prolog is based on \emph{top-down} search:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prolog is goal-driven.
    \item Prolog programs are imperative: the order of evaluation matters.
    \item Prolog is Turing-complete -- and hence programs may fail to terminate.
\end{itemize}

Prolog \emph{is} a logic programming language, but it is like the C of logic languages.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Expressive Power}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Syntax Update}
In Flix a Datalog rule looks like:
    
\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
Path(x, z) :- Edge(x, y), Path(y, z).
\end{lstlisting}

In Prolog syntax the casing is inverted:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
path(X, Z) :- edge(X, Y), path(Y, Z).
\end{lstlisting}

\pause

Moreover, in Prolog lowercase names are constants:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
parent(emma, magnus).
parent(emma, daniela).
\end{lstlisting}

\pause

\textbf{Warning:} You will screw this up. Remember to check your casing. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simple Query}

    Ask a query that has yes/no answer.

    You can see the roots in experts systems.
    
    Example: Non recursive query
    Show how we can get more solutions out.

    \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Recursive Query}

Example recursive query: We can stil search for paths.

But careful with recursion! Order can lead to non-termination

\section{Unification}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matching a Goal to a Rule}
Assume we have a Prolog program with the rules:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
len([], 0).
len([_Head|Tail], R) :- len(Tail, N), R is N + 1.
\end{lstlisting}

\pause 

And we ask Prolog the query:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
? len([1, 2], X).
\end{lstlisting}

which is really: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
? len([1 | [2 | []]], X).
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Question:} How does Prolog know which rule to evaluate and what the
values of the variables should be?

\pause 

\textbf{Answer:} Prolog uses \textbf{\emph{unification}} to match the goal with
the head atom.
\end{frame}   

\begin{frame}{What is Unification (1/2)}
A \textbf{\emph{substitution}} is a map from variables to terms.

\pause

For example, we can have the substitution:
\[
    s = \{ X \mapsto 21, Y \mapsto [1, 2, 3] \} 
\]

\pause

We can apply a substitution to a term. For example, 

if $t = node(X, X, Y)$ then 
\[
    s(t) = node(21, 21, [1, 2, 3])
\]
\end{frame}  

\begin{frame}{What is Unification (2/2)}

The \textbf{\emph{Unification Problem}} is: Given two terms $t_1$ and $t_2$,
find a substitution $s$ such that:
\[
    s(t_1) = s(t_2)
\]
That is, the substitution, when applied to both terms, makes them syntactically equal. 

Such a substition may not always exist. But, if it exists, it is unique.

\medskip

A cool idea, which we shall not see, is when $=$ is replaced by $\equiv$ leading
to E-unification, i.e. unification modulo some equational theory. 
\end{frame}  

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Unification Algorithm (in Flix) (1/6)}
We define the language of terms:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
enum Term {
    case Var(String),
    case Cst(Int32),
    case Pair(Term, Term)
}
\end{lstlisting}

A real term language, like the one used in Prolog, is richer.

However, the above term language is sufficient to illustrate the major points. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Unification Algorithm (in Flix) (2/6)}
We define a substitution as:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
type alias Subst = Map[String, Term]
\end{lstlisting}

\pause

And we define a function that applies a substition to a term:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
def applySubst(s: Subst, t: Term): Term = match t {
    case Term.Var(x)        => Map.getWithDefault(x, t, s)
    case Term.Cst(c)        => Term.Cst(c)
    case Term.Pair(t1, t2)  => 
        Term.Pair(applySubst(s, t1), applySubst(s, t2))
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Unification Algorithm (in Flix) (3/6)}
Given two substitutions $s_1$ and $s_2$, we define a function to compose them.

The idea is that the new substition should morally have the effect of applying
$s_1$ to the term and then applying $s_2$ to that, i.e. we want:

\[
    \text{compose}(s_1, s_2)(t) = s_2(s_1(t))
\]

\textbf{Implementation:} Left as an exercise for the reader.

\textbf{Remark:} Most bugs happen when implementing compose. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Unification Algorithm (in Flix) (4/6)}
We can now write a function to unify two terms:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
def unify(t1: Term, t2: Term): Subst = match (t1, t2) {
    case (Term.Cst(c1), Term.Cst(c2)) if c1 == c2 => Map.empty()
    case (Term.Var(x), _) => Map.singleton(x, t2)
    case (_, Term.Var(y)) => Map.singleton(y, t1)
    case (Term.Pair(t11, t12), Term.Pair(t21, t22)) => 
        let s1 = unify(t11, t21);
        let s2 = unify(applySubst(s1, t12), applySubst(s1, t22));
        compose(s1, s2)
    case _ => unsafe throw new Exception("Unification failed")
}
\end{lstlisting}

\pause

\textbf{Question:} Why apply \Code{s1} to \Code{t12} and \Code{t22} before the
recursive call to \Code{unify}?
\end{frame}  

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Unification Algorithm (in Flix) (5/6)}
Lets try it out: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
unify(Cst(123), Var("x")) 
  => Map#{x => Cst(123)}
\end{lstlisting}

\pause 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
unify(Pair(Var("x"), Var("x")), Pair(Cst(123), Var("y"))) 
  => Map#{x => Cst(123), y => Cst(123)}
\end{lstlisting}

\pause 

What about:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
unify(Var("x"), Pair(Cst(123), Var("x")))
  => Map#{x => Pair(Cst(123), Var(x))}
\end{lstlisting}

\pause 

\textbf{Ooops!} This is incorrect. What's the problem?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{A Unification Algorithm (in Flix) (6/6)}
We modify the two cases for variables as follows: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=flix, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
case (Term.Var(x), t2) => 
    if (Set.memberOf(x, freeVars(t2)))
        unsafe throw new Exception("Occurs Check") 
    else 
        Map.singleton(x, t2)

// The other case is symmetric.
\end{lstlisting}

This so-called \textbf{\emph{occurs check}} ensures that we do not construct
unifiers (i.e. substitutions) where a variable occurs recursively within the term
it is unified with. 

Here the \Code{freeVars} function is defined in the natural way. 

\pause

\textbf{Note:} The occurs check is expensive, so some Prolog implementations skip it.
\end{frame}  

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matching a Goal to a Rule -- Continued (1/2)}
Recall that we had: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
len([], 0).
len([_Head|Tail], R) :- len(Tail, N), R is N + 1.
\end{lstlisting}

And we ask: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
? len([1 | [2 | []]], X).
\end{lstlisting}

Prolog uses unification to the determine that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We cannot unify $[]$ with $[1 | [2 | []]]$ so the first rule (fact) is
    not applicable.
    \item We \emph{can} unify $[\_Head|Tail]$ with $[1 | [2 | []]]$ using the
    substitution $\{ \text{\_Head} \mapsto 1, \text{Tail} \mapsto [2 | []] \}$. 
    \item We then apply the substition to the rule body to obtain the new goals:
    $\text{len}([2 | []], R)$ and $R \text{ is } X + 1$, and recurse.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Matching a Goal to a Rule -- Continued (2/2)}
To recap:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prolog searches for a rule (or fact) \emph{from top to bottom} where the
    goal unifies with the head atom.
    \item If a match is found, Prolog applies the found substition to the rule
    body which now become the sub-goals of the query. 
    \item The sub-goals are evaluated from left to right.
    \item A goal is satisfied once we reach a fact (i.e. a base case). 
\end{itemize}

Hence: Be careful about evaluation order. It matters!
\end{frame}

\section{A Larger Example}

\begin{frame}{The Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage Problem (1/2)}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/river-problem.jpg}
\end{center}
\begin{small}
``The wolf, goat, and cabbage problem is a river crossing puzzle. It dates back
to at least the 9th century and has entered the folklore of several cultures.'' -- \textsl{Wikipedia}
\end{small}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage Problem (2/2)}
Via Wikipedia:

\bigskip

\begin{quote}
``A farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross a river by boat. The
boat can carry only the farmer and a single item. If left unattended together,
the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage. How can they
cross the river without anything being eaten?''
\end{quote}

\bigskip

We can solve this problem with Prolog. 

\pause

But can you solve it with your brain? (And some paper...)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage in Prolog (1/8)}
We consider the river to have two sides the west bank (\Code{w}) and east bank
(\Code{e}).

Initially, everyone will be on the west bank.

We can then define that one can travel from west to east and east to west:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
travel(w, e). 
travel(e, w).
\end{lstlisting}

We further assume we have three constants: \Code{farmer}, \Code{wolf},
\Code{goat}, \Code{cabbage}.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage in Prolog (2/8)}
We define a configuration of the problem as a 4-tuple (using a list):
%
We order the travelers as: \Code{farmer}, \Code{wolf}, \Code{goat},
\Code{cabbage}. Now:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The list: \Code{[w, w, w, w]} means that everyone is on the west bank.
    \item The list: \Code{[e, e, e, e]} means that everyone is on the east bank.
    \item The list: \Code{[e, e, e, w]} means that the farmer, wolf, and goat is
    on the east bank whereas the cabbage is on the west bank --- which is okay.
    \item The list: \Code{[e, w, w, e]} means that the farmer and cabbage is on
    the east bank whereas the wolf and the goat is on the east bank --- which is
    NOT OKAY!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
   
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage in Prolog (3/8)}
We now define a ternary relation: \texttt{move(state1, moved, state2)}:

If the farmer and wolf are on the west bank then they can travel to the east bank. 

The goat and cabbage stay where they are. 

We can capture this with the rule:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
move([w, w, G, C], wolf, [e, e, G, C]).
\end{lstlisting}

\pause

They can also travel back, so we need:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
move([e, e, G, C], wolf, [w, w, G, C]).
\end{lstlisting}

\pause

This is a bit tedious, so let us make use of \Code{travel}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
move([X, X, G, C], wolf, [Y, Y, G, C]) :- travel(X, Y).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage in Prolog (4/8)}
We have:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
move([X, X, G, C], wolf, [Y, Y, G, C]) :- travel(X, Y).
\end{lstlisting}

and we need three more rules:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
move([X, W, X, C], goat,    [Y, W, Y, C]) :- travel(X, Y).
move([X, W, G, X], cabbage, [Y, W, G, Y]) :- travel(X, Y).
move([X, W, G, C], nothing, [Y, W, G, C]) :- travel(X, Y).    
\end{lstlisting}

\pause

\textbf{Question:} Why do we need the last rule?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage in Prolog (5/8)}

\textbf{Recall:} We want to ensure that the (a) wolf does not eat the goat, and
(b) the goat does not eat the cabbage.

We define the states that are safe. There are two cases: 

(1) The goat is on the same bank as the farmer:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
safe([X, _, X, _]).  // Recall: farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage
\end{lstlisting}

(2) And the wolf and cabbage are on the same bank as the farmer:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
safe([X, X, _, X]).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage in Prolog (6/8)}
We can now define a solution: A solution is a pair of a state and a sequence of
moves that brings everyone safely to the east bank.

\pause

If everyone is already on the east bank there is nothing to be done:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
solution([e, e, e, e], []).
\end{lstlisting}

\pause 

Otherwise, we make a move to new state provided that it is (i) safe and (ii) solvable:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
solution(State, [FirstMove | OtherMoves]) :- 
    move(State, FirstMove, NextState), 
    safe(NextState), 
    solution(NextState, OtherMoves).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage in Prolog (7/8)}
We can now ask Prolog to compute a solution:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
? solution([w, w, w, w], X).
\end{lstlisting}

\pause 

And then we wait ...

\pause 

And then we wait some more ...

\pause 

And, hey, what's happening?

\pause 

\textbf{Problem:} We have infinitely many moves leading to no solution. The
farmer is just going back and forth, forever. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage in Prolog (8/8)}
\textbf{Solution:} We (indirectly) bound the recursion depth.

\pause

How? We fix the length of the list with moves:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
? length(X, 7), solution([w, w, w, w], X).
\end{lstlisting}

Prolog reports:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=prolog, xleftmargin=0.5cm]
X = [goat, nothing, wolf, goat, cabbage, nothing, goat]
\end{lstlisting}

\pause

\textbf{Question:} Why did I choose 7? How do I know what number to choose?

\pause

\begin{frame}{Prolog Extensions}
Like Datalog, Prolog comes with many extensions. 

We will not see them here, but some important are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item (\textbf{Cuts})   -- A mechanism to prevent backtracking across a goal. 
    \item (\textbf{IO})     -- Reading and writing files using logic predicates. 
    \item (\textbf{FP})     -- Integration with functional programming, e.g. Mercury.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Prolog Implementations}

\begin{frame}{Prolog Dialects and Implementations}

As with Datalog, there are many Prolog dialects and implementations.

The most popular Prolog implementations are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ciao Prolog} is an open-source research project from UPM and
    IMDEA {\small \url{https://ciao-lang.org/}}
    \item \textbf{Gnu Prolog} is an open-source Prolog implementation \linebreak
    {\small \url{http://www.gprolog.org/}}
    \item \textbf{SWI Prolog} is an open-source Prolog implementation {\small
    \url{https://www.swi-prolog.org/}}
    \item \textbf{XSB Prolog} is a commercial Prolog implementation with tabling
    {\small \url{https://xsb.com/xsb-prolog/}}
\end{itemize}

Wikipedia, as always, has an extensive list of Prolog implementations: {\small

\begin{frame}{Summary}
Prolog is a goal-driven logic programming language:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Datalog is for tabling. Prolog is for search. 
\end{itemize}

Prolog is Turing-complete. We get the good and the bad: 
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can express what we want, but programs may fail to terminate.
\end{itemize}

Prolog feels imperative: the order of rules and clauses matter. 

Prolog supports complex data (lists, trees, ...) which are destructed using unification.

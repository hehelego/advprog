% This document has the following requirements:
% - Fira Code
%   - see https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing
% - Xelatex
%   - This should be automatically activated by the magic comment above,
%     But VSCode prevents this. Use the following setting to allow the
%     magic comment to work:
%     latex-workshop.latex.build.forceRecipeUsage: false
%     This setting should already be set by the workspace settings
%
% The manual is here:
% https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/beamer-contrib/themes/metropolis/doc/metropolistheme.pdf

% Trouble shotting:
%
% If you get this error:
%
%   Couldn't open `Fira Mono .cfg'
%   Sorry, but miktex-maketfm did not succeed.
%
% then go to: https://github.com/mozilla/Fira
% and download the repository, and
% install the fonts in the OTF folder.

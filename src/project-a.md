## Logic Programming Project

The following ideas may be used for inspiration:

**Implement a Complex Domain (e.g. rules for a board game, card game, or tax code)**
- As a logic program using Datalog
- As a logic program using Flix
- As a logic program using Prolog

**Implement a Logic Programming Language**
- Implement a Datalog engine (e.g. using semi-naive evaluation)
- Implement a Prolog engine (e.g. using SLD resolution)
- Implement a third logic programming language (e.g. ASP)

**Learn Another Logic Programming Language**
- Explore [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) and use it for some program
  analysis. 
- Explore [Datafun](http://www.rntz.net/datafun/) and use it solve some
  programming problems
- Explore [FormuLog](https://harvardpl.github.io/formulog/) and use it solve
  some programming problems
- Explore [Mercury](https://mercurylang.org/) and use it solve some programming
  problems
- Explore [miniKanren](http://minikanren.org/) and use it solve some programming
  problems

**Extend the Datalog Solver in Flix**
- Enrich its semantics with new features
- Improve its performance and/or scalability
- Improve its ergonomics (e.g. VSCode support)
